# Project Environment

## Application Runtime

- The application is **always running in the background** during development sessions
- There is no need to start the application manually with `npm run dev` when working together
- Changes to files may trigger automatic reloads of the application

## Development Workflow

- Focus on making code changes without worrying about starting/stopping the server
- Database migrations and seeding should still be run explicitly when needed
- The application can be accessed at [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) at any time

## Testing Changes

- Code changes can be immediately tested in the running application
- For database schema changes, run migrations explicitly:
  ```
  node ace migration:fresh
  ```
- For data seeding, run seeders explicitly:
  ```
  node ace db:seed --files=path/to/seeder.ts
  ```

## Troubleshooting

- If the application appears unresponsive, the issue is likely in your code changes
- Check the console logs for any errors (they're being monitored in the background)
- Focus on fixing code rather than restarting services

## Important Note

When developing code changes:
1. Make changes to relevant files
2. Run database migrations or seeders if needed
3. Test changes directly in the running application
4. No need to manually start/stop the application
