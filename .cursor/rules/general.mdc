- Always read the relevant MDC rules before proceeding with a task.
- Always mention what cursor rules you are using before proceeding.
- `+types` are autogenerated by react-router. If missing, they might be available by running `npx react-router typegen`. If you have trouble with the `Route` types being unknown or similar, it might be because you're not following the proper hybrid route convention in [remix-flat-routes.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/remix-flat-routes.mdc)
