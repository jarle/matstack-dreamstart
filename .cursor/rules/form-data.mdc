- Use the react-router `useFetcher()` hook and its `fetcher.Form` component.
- Implement the different states for the form pending/loading state
- Form submissions are validated using [intent-validation.ts](mdc:resources/remix_app/utils/intent-validation.ts). The form should have a hidden input with name `intent` which is the key for the intent validation, along with an object corresponding to the other input elements. The vine validator is then used like so:
```ts
const actionValidator = intentValidation({
  login: {
    email: vine.string().email().toLowerCase(),
  }
})

const r = await http.request.validateUsing(actionValidator)
if (r.intent === 'login') {
  // here the type will be narrowed to the login shape and `email` will be available
}
```
