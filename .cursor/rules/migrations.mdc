description: Database migrations and when adding or modifying datatbase models
globs: database/migrations/*, app/models/*

- We use AdonisJS Lucid to handle migrations and database models. Lucid is based on Knex.
- All models are placed in `app/models`, and all database interaction goes through these models.
- All database migrations are placed in `database/migrations`.
- For creating new models, including a migration file (for example User): `node ace make:model -m User`
- For creating new migrations only: `node ace make:migration users`
