# Project Path Aliases

## Important Path Aliases

- `#web/*` - Points to `./resources/remix_app/*` (defined in tsconfig.json)
- `#web/components` - Used for shadcn components and utilities
  - Example: `import { cn } from "#web/lib/utils"`

## Shadcn Component Imports

Shadcn components are located in `#web/components/ui/` and are imported using:

```ts
import { ComponentName } from "#web/components/ui/component-name"
```

Remember to always include the `.js` extension in relative imports, even though the actual files have `.ts` or `.tsx` extensions (this is a TypeScript module resolution convention).
