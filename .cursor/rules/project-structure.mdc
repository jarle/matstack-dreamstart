description: Understanding the project structure
globs:

- The application is split in two: AdonisJS backend and Remix frontend. They are compiled into one app with vite and tsc.
- The frontend interacts with the backend at runtime using the IoC container and HTTP request, not through APIs.
- The general structure is based on AdonisJS 6 structure, with the Remix application placed in `resources/remix_app`
- The two parts of the application should not have direct code dependency, but they can and should share types.
