- The application is split in two: AdonisJS backend and Remix frontend. They are compiled into one app with vite and tsc.
- The frontend interacts with the backend at runtime using the IoC container services and HTTP request context, not through APIs. See [adding-services.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/adding-services.mdc) for services.
- The general structure is based on AdonisJS 6 structure, with the Remix application placed in `resources/remix_app`
- The two parts of the application should not have direct code dependency, but they can and should share types.
