globs: resources/remix_app/**/*
---
- Use Suspend with Async when possible to make UI snappy
- Avoid too many conditionals inside components, use composition instead.
- Use the flat routes convention `kiliman/remix-flat-routes` when organizing the UI.
- Add components with shadcn like this: `npx shadcn@latest add <component>`
