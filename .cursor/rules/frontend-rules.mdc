- Use React Suspend with Async when possible to make the UI snappy
- Avoid too many conditionals inside components, use composition instead.
- Use the flat routes convention `kiliman/remix-flat-routes` when organizing the UI, see [remix-flat-routes.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/remix-flat-routes.mdc)
- Add components using instructions in [frontend-components.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/frontend-components.mdc)
