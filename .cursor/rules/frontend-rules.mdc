- The target audience is a general population - use simple user-friendly language and avoid technical terms
- Use spacing to create a UI that breathes and is visually pleasant
- Use React Suspend with Async when possible to make the UI snappy
- Use optimistic updates when mutating data as described in [optimistic-updates.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/optimistic-updates.mdc)
- Avoid ternaries and the `boolean && <Component />` pattern inside components, use composition instead.
- Break down react components into several smaller components
  - Prefer the `useLoaderData` hook in components over passing props
- Use the flat routes convention `kiliman/remix-flat-routes` when organizing the UI, see [remix-flat-routes.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/remix-flat-routes.mdc)
- Avoid using emojis, use the included icon library instead.
- Avoid content shift when possible
  - Try to use skeletons and sensible placeholders when data is loading
  - Also make sure pagination is smooth without navigational controls moving around
- Avoid using margin for your components; prefer flex gap and padding
