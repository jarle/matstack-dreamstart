description: Adding new services
globs: 
---
- The frontend uses services in loaders/actions through the AdonisJS IoC container.
- Service classes are located under `app/services` (path alias `#services`)
- Services should be added with the command `node ace add:service ServiceName` which will instantiate a new class in the `#services` folder.
- Simple services can be one file, more intricate services get their own folder when more files are required.
- The `@inject()` decorator can be used to inject other services when needed.
- After adding a new service, it should be registered as a singleton in the IoC container at `app/services/_index.ts`
