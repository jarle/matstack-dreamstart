- The remix app root is aliased as `#web/` for imports
- Remix is now merged into React Router. Import remix code from `react-router`.
- Typing of actions and loaders are described in [remix-types.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/remix-types.mdc): tldr: loader/action types are typegenerated by react-router.
- Environment variables can be accessed from the context ([remix-service-interaction.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/remix-service-interaction.mdc)): `const env = await make('env')`
- Always throw redirects to ensure proper type inference in loaders and actions:
```ts
// Correct - throws the redirect
throw redirect('/path')
```
- In auth routes, the current user is available on the http context auth property:
`const user = http.auth.getUserOrFail()`
