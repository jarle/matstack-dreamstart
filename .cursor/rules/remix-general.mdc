- The remix app root is aliased as `#web/` for imports
- Remix is now merged into React Router. Import remix code from `react-router`. If it's not available there, it might be in `@react-router/node`
- Typing of actions and loaders are described in [remix-types.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/remix-types.mdc)
- Environment variables can be accessed from the context ([remix-service-interaction.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/remix-service-interaction.mdc)): `const env = await make('env')`
- **Always throw redirects** rather than returning them to ensure proper type inference in loaders and actions:
```ts
// Correct - throws the redirect
throw redirect('/path')
```
