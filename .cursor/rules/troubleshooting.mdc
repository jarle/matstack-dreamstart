Problem: The react-router `Route.LoaderArgs` type gives linting errors
Solution: See [remix-types.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/remix-types.mdc)

Problem: Types are unknown or not correct
Solution: Don't introduce unnecessary types, use type inference as described in [remix-types.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/remix-types.mdc)
