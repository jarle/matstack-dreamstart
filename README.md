Thank you for trying out Dreamstart!

Dreamstart is an **opinionated starter kit** for building web apps with [react-adonisjs](https://matstack.dev/react-adonisjs/).

Dreamstart was created for quickly developing and launching great products.
The goal is not simply to glue together different technologies and call it a day, but rather to create a blueprint for building robust products.

## Quickstart

Create a new Dreamstart project using this command:

```
npm init adonisjs@latest -- -K="github:jarle/matstack-dreamstart"
```

1. Run `docker compose up` to start all services
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
1. Run `npm run dev` to start the app
